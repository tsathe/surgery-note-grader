#### 1\. History, Physical, **and Data**

Evaluates whether the consult note captures the key aspects of the patient’s history, physical exam, **surgically focused review of systems, and objective data (e.g. labs, imaging)** that are pertinent to the consult question. The section should reflect accuracy, focus, and inclusion of essential details, while avoiding irrelevant or extraneous information.

| Score | Level | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Limited | Missing or inaccurate; irrelevant details dominate; critical findings absent. **Has irrelevant or inaccurate copy forwarded elements such as physical exam that was not performed** |
| 2 | Developing | Some relevant info, but major omissions or questionable accuracy. |
| 3 | Competent | Captures main story, exam, and relevant data but misses some pertinent positives/negatives or includes minor irrelevant info. |
| 4 | Strong | Accurate, mostly complete, focused on key findings; only minimal extraneous content. **Concisely includes surgically relevant review of systems with minimal extraneous details** |
| 5 | Complete & Concise | All essential findings included, no extraneous details. Brief if straightforward (e.g. appendicitis), more detailed if complex (e.g. Crohn’s obstruction), but always targeted and relevant. |

#### 2\. Assessment & Clinical Reasoning

Evaluates the quality of the resident’s interpretation of the case. This section should not restate the history; it should demonstrate synthesis, provide a leading diagnosis (or outline what is needed to establish one), **and acknowledge alternative possibilities only when the diagnosis is not clear.** The level of detail should be tailored to the case complexity — concise for straightforward consults (e.g., appendicitis) and more detailed for complex cases (e.g., Crohn’s obstruction) — but always relevant.

| Score | Level | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Limited | Restates HPI without analysis; no diagnosis or impression offered. |
| 2 | Developing | Impression vague or incomplete; does not answer consult question; no reasoning or alternatives considered for complex cases. |
| 3 | Competent | States a working diagnosis, but with little justification; may omit a differential diagnosis for complex cases where diagnosis is not clear. **May have some restatement of history or data without analysis** |
| 4 | Strong | **Clearly states a diagnosis for straightforward cases, provides a differential diagnosis for complex cases.** |
| 5 | Complete & Concise | Concise synthesis that takes a stand (or states what is needed to establish a diagnosis); justified with relevant findings; alternatives addressed. Short and direct if obvious, more detailed if complex, but always relevant. **Clearly shows thought process in evaluating complex cases** |

#### 3\. Plan & Management

Evaluates the clarity, specificity, and appropriateness of the management plan. The plan should respond directly to the consult question, outline specific next steps, and **anticipate surgically relevant contingencies**. It should not be vague or avoidant, but instead provide actionable recommendations.

| Score | Level | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Limited | Either no clear plan or unsafe or irrelevant plan |
| 2 | Developing | Vague (“continue care”), incomplete, or avoids giving recommendations. |
| 3 | Competent | Addresses primary problem but misses key steps; plan nonspecific. |
| 4 | Strong | Clear, appropriate plan addressing most issues; specific and actionable, but may lack anticipation of next steps. |
| 5 | Complete & Concise | Directly answers consult request with specific, tailored recommendations; anticipates next steps (workup, OR vs non-op, contingencies). High-yield if straightforward; more detailed if complex, but never vague or padded. |

#### 4\. Clarity & Efficiency

Evaluates how well the note is structured and whether it communicates information clearly and efficiently. Notes should be easy to follow and contain only pertinent information. Copy forwarded material is used sparingly where appropriate. Both brief, straightforward consults notes and appropriately detailed complex consult notes should be rewarded if written clearly **and without vague or irrelevant details**. 

| Score | Level | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Limited | Disorganized, confusing, bloated with irrelevant/copy-forwarded text; key message obscured. |
| 2 | Developing | Some logical flow, but redundancy/clutter makes it hard to extract key points. |
| 3 | Competent | Understandable overall, but with mild redundancy, awkward phrasing, or minor irrelevant content. |
| 4 | Strong | Well-structured, mostly concise; easy to follow; minimal irrelevant content. |
| 5 | Complete & Concise | Exceptionally clear, succinct, efficient. For simple cases, communicates everything in a few crisp lines; for complex cases, includes all needed information **with no irrelevant content** |
